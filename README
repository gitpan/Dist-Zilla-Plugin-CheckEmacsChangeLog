NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckEmacsChangeLog - Check missing version in
    ChangeLog

VERSION
    version 0.0.2

SYNOPSIS
        # dist.ini

        # or
        [CheckEmacsChangeLog]
        filename = another.file.name

DESCRIPTION
    It is a simple extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckChangeLog allowing
    to check that a sentence about a new version was added to a file
    "ChangeLog" in your project. It differs from the
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckChangeLog by expecting the format of the
    "ChangeLog" file being the one used by the Emacs's ChangeLog mode. Which
    means, for example, this one:

          * Version 0.0.1 released

ATTRIBUTES
    There is one optional attribute "filename" allowing to change the file
    name with the logs:

        [CheckEmacsChangeLog]
        filename = another.file.name

    The main reason for having this attribute is that it has a default value
    "ChangeLog" (suitable for Emacs) which is different from the one used in
    the original Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckChangeLog.
